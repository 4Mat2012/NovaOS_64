🚀 NovaOS
Hi there! I'm Türker. This project is my entry ticket into the world of Operating System development.

🧐 What is this?
NovaOS is a simple kernel attempt running on the x86_64 architecture, using the Limine bootloader. As a 13-year-old developer, I'm chasing the answer to one question: "Can I actually build this?"

🎯 The Goal
I know it's a huge challenge, especially with a giant like Linux out there.

Plan A: If I succeed, this will evolve into a real, solid project just like Linux.

Plan B: If I get stuck and give up at some point, this repository will find an honorable place in my "GitHub graveyard." At least I'll be able to say, "I tried!"

🛠️ Current Status
[x] Booting with Limine

[x] Rendering colors with Framebuffer (Gradient experiments)

[ ] GDT and IDT setup (Next on the list!)

[ ] Basic font engine and text rendering

Note: I've made all my code public. I want everyone to see the struggles I've faced and where I got stuck. My mistakes are part of my growth!
